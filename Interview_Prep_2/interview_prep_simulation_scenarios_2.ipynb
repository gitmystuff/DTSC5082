First thing is to run this notebook as is. The code in this notebook generates some messy data and two dependent variables, one for a linear regression model, and one for a logistic regression model. After you run the notebook, then continue to the Data Prep Process and complete the rest of the notebook. You are also asked to select the 5 most important features, and evaluate your models using appropriate metrics. Be sure to be able to explain the rational for each action you take. Finally provide a summary at the end of the notebook that let's your future boss know your analysis and findings."

        "When performing data preparation, the order of operations is crucial for a robust and reproducible machine learning pipeline. While there isn't one single \"best\" order that fits every scenario, a logical and widely accepted sequence follows a general flow from broad data quality checks to more specific feature transformations. This ensures that early steps, like removing bad data, don't get skewed by later transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general best-practice order is:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Remove Bad Data and Redundancy:** Begin by identifying and removing data that's problematic at a fundamental level.\n",
        "    * **Duplicates**: Removing duplicate rows is the first step. They can bias a model and inflate performance metrics.\n",
        "    * **Constants**: Columns with only one unique value (constants) provide no information for a model to learn from. Removing them early reduces dimensionality and simplifies your dataset.\n",
        "    * **Quasi-Constants**: Similar to constants, these features have very little variance (e.g., 99% of values are the same). It's generally a good idea to remove them as they offer minimal predictive power.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Handle Missing Data and Outliers:** Once your data is free of redundant rows and features, you can address quality issues within the remaining columns.\n",
        "    * **Missing Data**: Decide on a strategy for handling missing values. This can involve dropping rows or columns with too much missing data, or **imputing** values using methods like the mean, median, or more advanced techniques.\n",
        "    * **Outliers**: After addressing missing data, identify and handle outliers. Outliers can heavily influence the mean and other statistics, so it's important to deal with them before transformations or scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Perform Feature Engineering:** This is a creative and domain-specific step where you can extract more information from your existing features.\n",
        "    * **Datetime**: Extracting meaningful features from datetime columns, such as month, day of the week, or holiday flags, is a common and powerful technique. This should be done before more generic transformations.\n",
        "    * **Feature Creation**: This is the core of feature engineering, where you create new variables based on your domain knowledge. For example, creating a `BMI` feature from `height` and `weight`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Transform Variables and Features:** With a clean and feature-rich dataset, you can now prepare the variables for the specific requirements of your chosen model.\n",
        "    * **Discretization**: If needed, convert continuous numerical features into discrete bins. This is often used for algorithms that benefit from binned data, like certain tree-based models.\n",
        "    * **Categorical Encoding**: Convert all categorical features (which may have been `object` or `category` data types) into a numerical format. This is a non-negotiable step for most machine learning algorithms. The choice between one-hot encoding, label encoding, etc., depends on the nature of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Scale Features:** The final step before training a model is often scaling, which adjusts the range of numerical features.\n",
        "    * **Scaling**: This is especially important for distance-based algorithms like **K-nearest Neighbors** and models that use gradient descent, such as **Linear Regression** and **Neural Networks**. Common techniques are **Normalization** (Min-Max Scaling) and **Standardization** (Z-Score Scaling). This should be done **after** all other transformations to prevent data leakage and ensure the scaling is based on the final, prepared feature values.\n"

For any given data point, one of these new columns will be a `1` and the rest will be `0`s.\n",

If you know the values for `is_New_York` and `is_Chicago`, you can perfectly predict the value for `is_Boston`: if `is_New_York` is 0 and `is_Chicago` is 0, then `is_Boston` must be 1.

By having only $k-1$ dummy variables for a categorical variable with $k$ categories, you eliminate the perfect multicollinearity. The dropped category becomes the **baseline** or **reference category**, and the coefficients of the remaining dummy variables are interpreted in comparison to that baseline."

        "\n",
        "* https://mikulskibartosz.name/time-in-machine-learning\n",
        "\n",
        "The best way to encode days of the week for machine learning depends on whether the model can recognize and use the inherent **cyclical** nature of the data. The two most effective methods are **one-hot encoding** and **sinusoidal (or cyclical) encoding**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**One-Hot Encoding**\n",
        "One-hot encoding is a straightforward method that creates a new binary column for each day of the week. This is an excellent choice for models that don't inherently handle cyclical data well, such as linear regression and tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **How it works**: A feature like \"Day of Week\" with values like 'Monday', 'Tuesday', etc., is transformed into 7 new columns: `is_Monday`, `is_Tuesday`, etc. For a given row, the column corresponding to the correct day will have a value of 1, and all other new columns will be 0.\n",
        "* **Pros**:\n",
        "    * Simple and easy to implement.\n",
        "    * Works with virtually all machine learning models.\n",
        "    * Prevents the model from incorrectly assuming an ordinal relationship (e.g., thinking that Saturday is \"less than\" Sunday).\n",
        "* **Cons**:\n",
        "    * Can create a large number of features, especially for data with high cardinality.\n",
        "    * Doesn't capture the cyclical relationship of the days (e.g., Sunday is closer to Monday than to Wednesday).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sinusoidal (Cyclical) Encoding**\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is ideal for models that can leverage the continuous, cyclical nature of the data, such as neural networks. It transforms the day of the week into two new features using sine and cosine functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **How it works**: Each day is mapped to an angle on a circle. Monday might be 0 degrees, Tuesday 51.4 degrees ($360/7$), and so on, with Sunday wrapping back around to Monday. The sine and cosine of these angles are then used as two new features. The formulas are:\n",
        "    * $Sine\\_Feature = sin(\\frac{2 \\pi \\times day\\_of\\_week}{7})$\n",
        "    * $Cosine\\_Feature = cos(\\frac{2 \\pi \\times day\\_of\\_week}{7})$\n",
        "    \n",
        "    This creates a continuous representation where the distance between days is preserved, and the cyclical nature is explicitly encoded.\n",
        "* **Pros**:\n",
        "    * Explicitly captures the cyclical relationship, which can improve model performance.\n",
        "    * Creates only two new features, regardless of the number of days, reducing dimensionality.\n",
        "* **Cons**:\n",
        "    * Can be more complex to implement than one-hot encoding.\n",
        "    * The model must be able to effectively use these continuous features.\n",
        "    * Less interpretable than one-hot encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation**\n",
        "For a majority of cases, **one-hot encoding** is a safe and reliable choice, especially for tree-based models and simpler linear models. It ensures no false ordinal relationships are introduced. However, if you are using a neural network or a model that benefits from continuous, cyclical features, **sinusoidal encoding** is the better and more elegant solution as it directly encodes the underlying structure of the data."
